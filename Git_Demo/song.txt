Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you and where do you go?

You've never seen nothing like it
No, never in your life
Like going up to heaven
And then coming back alive

Let me tell you all about it
And the world will so allow it
Ooh, give me a little time to choose

Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the black queen, poking in the pile
Fie-fo the black queen, marching single file

Take this, take that
Bring them down to size
March to the black queen

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun

Make this, make that
Keep making all that noise
March to the black queen

Now I've got a belly full
You can be my sugar baby
You can be my honey chile, yes
